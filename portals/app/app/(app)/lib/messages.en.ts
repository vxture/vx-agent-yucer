// The en-US dictionary.
//
// IT SPREADS zh AND OVERRIDES. Every key not listed below is still Chinese, on
// purpose and visibly: an English reader meeting a Chinese string learns that
// this page has not been translated yet, which is true. The alternative -
// stubbing every key with a machine rendering - would hide the same fact behind
// text that reads as finished.
//
// Each override is TYPE-CHECKED against its Chinese counterpart, so a renamed
// key breaks the build and a function cannot quietly change its arity.
//
// TRANSLATED SO FAR: the shell chrome - what surrounds every page. Page
// dictionaries follow. `grep -c "^  [A-Z_]*:" ` against this file counts what
// is done; the 61 constants in messages.ts are the denominator.
